# Integration test harness useful for testing the GitHub Action itself
# Setup for this action is defined in action.yml
# This can be run locally using act (https://github.com/nektos/act) like this:
# act -v -j build --
# This will build the docker image that packages the GitHub Action and run it,
#     with verbose logging to show each step in detail
