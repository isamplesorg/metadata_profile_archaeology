hair is composed of three parts: the innermost column is the medula,
the surrounding live cells (the cortex) contain pigment, and the
outermost dead transparent cells are the cuticular scales. The portion
of the hair outside of the skin is called the shaft. Fine, closely
spaced hair that covers most of an animal's body is called fur. Dense,
soft, curled hair is called wool. Coarse, stiff hairs are called
bristles, spines, or quills. Horsehair and cattle hair have been used
for brushes, plaster binders, haircloth, and upholstery stuffing.
Rabbit hair, often called rabbit fur, has been used to make felt hats.
