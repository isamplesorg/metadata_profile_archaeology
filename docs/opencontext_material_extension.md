**Concepts**

[]{#anthropogenicmetal}

##  anthropogenic metal


- Specimen is dominantly composed of metal that has been produced or
used by humans; subclass of anthropogenic material. Samples of
naturally occuring metallic material (e.g. native copper, gold
nuggets) should be considered mineral material. Metallic material is
material that when polished or fractured, shows a lustrous appearance,
and conducts electricity and heat relatively well. Metals are
typically malleable (they can be hammered into thin sheets) or ductile
(can be drawn into wires). The boundaries between metals, nonmetals,
and metalloids fluctuate slightly due to a lack of universally
accepted definitions of the categories involved.

- Material consists of a single mineral or mineraloid phase. .  'A

processes.' (Nickel, Ernest H. (1995), The definition of a mineral,
The Canadian Mineralogist. 33 (3): 689â€“90). Include mineraloids. ... A
material primarily composed of some substance that is naturally
occurring, solid and stable at room temperature, representable by a
chemical formula, usually abiogenic, and that has an ordered atomic
structure. (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000256). Comment:
the identity of a mineral species is defined by a crystal structure
and a chemical composition that might include various specific
elemental substitutions in that structure. Mineraloid: A naturally
occurring mineral-like substance that does not demonstrate
crystallinity. Mineraloids possess chemical compositions that vary
beyond the generally accepted ranges for specific minerals. Examples:
obsidian, Opal. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineraloid)

outermost dead transparent cells are the cuticular scales. The portion
of the hair outside of the skin is called the shaft. Fine, closely
spaced hair that covers most of an animal's body is called fur. Dense,
soft, curled hair is called wool. Coarse, stiff hairs are called
bristles, spines, or quills. Horsehair and cattle hair have been used
for brushes, plaster binders, haircloth, and upholstery stuffing.
Rabbit hair, often called rabbit fur, has been used to make felt hats.
