# **Concept scheme:** Open Context vocabulary extension for material sample type

no modified date

subtitle: 
  created based on summary of 'type' values found in OpenContext sample descriptions. This is a bottom-up vocabulary intended as a first draft and demonstration of a material sample type extension for the Open Context community in the iSamples context. Most of the categories are subclasses of spec:Artifact, except for 'bone object' which is a spec:OrganismPart.
